# Internationalization 

Our flower shop is expanding! We will need to support stores in Spain ASAP. Complete each task listed below to internationalize your site. 

1. (UI) Add a column to the flowers table to display the `createdAt` date and time. Format the date and time in a way that's readable to a typical user. 
2. (fullstack) We would like to make the `createdAt` editable. Add an edit button next to the `createdAt` field that allows the user to edit using text input for the time and a calender to edit the date. 
3. (fullstack) Allow the user to also edit the `createdAt` date/time when they are adding a flower. 
4. (fullstack) Create a language selector on the site, users should be able to choose between English or Spanish. The language on the site update instantly. Hint: take a close look at your date/time formats and your calendar. 
5. (fullstack) Detect the country your user's browser is in to set the initial language that the site loads. 
6. (UI) Update the URL so users can go to the `/usa` site or the `/sp` site. 
7. (fullstack) Create a new page named `EMPLOYEES`. On this page you will be displaying a list of our employees which you can get from here http://dummy.restapiexample.com/. Display the employee's name. This page should only be displayed it the users are on the `/usa` site.
8. (fullstack) Currently, users cannot add families. Add an `Add family` button to the Family tab. Only display the `Add family` button if the user is on the `/sp` site.

# Advanced Routes 

Complete the following tasks.

1. (UI) Currently, the URL does not update when the user toggles between `flowers` and `family`. Update the URL to `/family` when we are on the `family` tab
2. (UI) Currently, on the `family` tab users can expand/collapse families to show the flowers in them, however, on refresh the families return to a collapsed position. Allow the users keep their expanded/collapsed state when they refresh the page.
3. (UI) Create a flower details page that is accessible by selecting a flower. The page should contain the flower's name, family, and created at date/time. 
4. (UI) Create a family details page that is accessible by selecting a family. The page should contain the family's name, flowers in the family, and created at date/time. 
5. (fullstack) Currently, users cannot edit flowers. Add and edit button to the flower details page, if the user refreshes they should still be in an edit mode. On the edit page, users should be able to edit the flower's name and family or delete the flower altogether. Changes made to a flower should be reflected in UI without needing to refresh. 
6. (fullstack) Currently, users cannot edit families. Add and edit button to the family details page, if the user refreshes they should still be in an edit mode.
